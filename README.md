This project implements a simple neural network in JavaScript using the P5 extension. The `RedeNeural` class represents a neural network with customizable numbers of input, hidden, and output nodes. It includes methods for feedforwarding input data through the network and computing the output.

The `Matrix` class provides basic matrix operations used in the neural network implementation, such as matrix multiplication, addition, and Hadamard product. These operations are essential for performing calculations within the neural network layers.

To Do: Implement
- Static Map function
- Hadamard Product
- Scalar Product
- Matrix Transposition
- Matrix Subtraction

### To use the project:
1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/HeannaReis/Neural-Networks
    ```

2. **Open the project directory in VS Code:**
    ```
    cd Neural-Networks
    ```

3. **Install the P5.js extension if not already installed.**

4. **Open the index.html file in your browser:**
    - Ensure you are running it on a local server, such as `localhost:3000`.

5. **Review the setup() and draw() functions in the sketch.js file:**
    - Understand how to initialize and interact with the neural network.

Feel free to experiment with different network configurations and input data to observe how the neural network behaves. Contributions to the project are welcome via pull requests.
